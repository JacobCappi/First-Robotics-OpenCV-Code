# First-Robotics-OpenCV-Code
Some code that my mentor and I worked on during First Robotics.

Code was rushed out in a few months, so the quality may be poor,
but it is what it is.

Also, didn't know how to build a proper makefile, so the 'makefile'
is a shell script that runs a gnu compiler on a lot of different files.
